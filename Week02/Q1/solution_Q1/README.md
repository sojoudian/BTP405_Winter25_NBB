# Explanation:
	1.	Input Validation: If n is negative, return an empty list since Fibonacci numbers are non-negative.
	2.	Base Cases: Initialize the list with the first two Fibonacci numbers, [0, 1].
	3.	Generate Sequence:
	•	Use a loop to calculate the next Fibonacci number by summing the last two numbers in the list.
	•	Stop if the next Fibonacci number exceeds n.
	4.	Return Result: Return the list of Fibonacci numbers, ensuring it accommodates edge cases (e.g., when n is 0 or 1).
