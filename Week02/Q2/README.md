## Problem Statement

You are given the monthly rainfall (in mm) for a year in a specific region. The data is as follows:

| Month       | Rainfall (mm) |
|-------------|---------------|
| January     | 75            |
| February    | 60            |
| March       | 100           |
| April       | 125           |
| May         | 175           |
| June        | 200           |
| July        | 225           |
| August      | 210           |
