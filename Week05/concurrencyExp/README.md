# Question:
How can a Python server handle multiple client connections concurrently using threads and manage shared memory safely? Provide an example of a multi-threaded socket server that accepts multiple client connections, processes messages, and maintains a shared counter using a threading lock. Include both server and client code along with an explanation of how concurrency is handled.
