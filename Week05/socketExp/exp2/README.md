# Question 2
How can a Python client serialize an object using `pickle`, send it over a socket, and have a server deserialize and process it? Provide an example where a server receives a pickled dictionary from a client, deserializes it, and prints the received object. Include both server and client code along with an explanation of how the communication works.
